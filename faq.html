  <summary>Why is Convivium in the US?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer text-containe">
When narrowing down locations, we had several primary criteria for what kinds of venues and places we’d look at. The first is that, since it’s an all volunteer army, we had to have someone willing to spearhead a given location. While we did our best to scout diverse ideas and locations, ultimately there were some global locations that did not have coverage due to lack of familiarity within the organizers. We ended up settling on venues primarily in Europe and the US, however, due to the estimated lower number of attendees in Europe, the per person price was going to be substantially higher for the European venues we were considering. Given the high level of price sensitivity of this community as expressed in the survey, we decided on the venue that had a ticket price most closely aligned with the desired ticket price.

  <summary>Why is it so expensive?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer text-containe">
Costs have risen significantly in the past couple years. Taking into account the feedback from last Convivium regarding venue amenities and activities, we wanted to make sure we built upwards rather than cutting out what people enjoyed while also not fixing the things they didn’t. Additionally, there are many more venues to accommodate these types of gatherings with 100-200 attendants as opposed to this year’s estimated size of 300+.

  <div class="faq-answer text-containe">
Everything from bus pick up to bus drop off is taken care of by your ticket price. All food and beverage, activities, accommodations, linens, etc are covered. You will need to provide your own toiletries. What is not included are your transportation to and from the bus pickup location which will be somewhere in the NYC metro area.

  <summary>Is financial aid available and how will it be allocated?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer text-containe">
Financial aid will be available in a limited amount pending availability of surplus funds and community donations. We are also actively pursuing outside donations to enable maximum attendance regardless of ability to pay. Aid will be determined on a case to case basis as determined by individual need, commitment to attend, and availability of funds.

  <summary>Are there single rooms available?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer text-containe">
 A very limited number of single rooms will be available at the camp. Preference will be given towards attendees who require a single room due to reasonable and necessary accommodation reasons. After those with accessibility and accommodation concerns are taken into consideration, any remaining rooms will be allocated to those who have specified their desire to have a single room and have paid the single-room interest deposit on a first come first serve basis. To express interest, you must pay the full $500 ticket price and indicate that you want a single room. If one is available, we will reach out to individuals. If they would like to accept the single room, they will have to pay the additional $250 to secure the single room.
